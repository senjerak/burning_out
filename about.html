            <h1>Who... and What are we?</h1>
            <p>"Burning Out" is a modern, recycled sculpture that utilizes 'disposable' tech in a re-use
                initiative to
                spread more awareness of sustaining Electronic Waste. Utilizing 60 different LED sensor chips found in
                Electronic Cigarettes, each light represents 20$ to 30$ spent just to contribute to a modern-day
                littering
                crisis.
                Together that is 2'000$ worth of electronics that could have been left out in parking lots, parks,
                and
                even trash bins. Lithium Batteries, hidden within each Vape, are incredibly prone to causing fires,
                toxic pollution, and exploding.<br><br>
                Resting against a Wooden Backing and powered by 5v of Electricity from an Arduino Uno, the Recycled LED structure is made of 18 and 12
                gauge pure copper wire that was hand soldered together into the shape of Lungs to display
                several
                various blinking patterns embedded within the chip. Because these sensors detect air pressure, you can
                interact with the display by blowing on it to turn on specific lights fixed throughout the metal
                organ that picks up on the air hitting it. This website will document the many steps and
                initiatives taken in order to complete this project in time for the 2023 Spring Semester. Imaging Processes, taught by my Professor Alisa Pitchenik Charles, is one of the most beloved classes that I have taken at New World School of the Arts.

            <h1>...Why?</h1>
            <p>The only way to put an end to
                littering
                as a whole is to spread awareness on how to properly dispose of your electronics and why it is so important
                to
                do so, to begin with. The bank of dud Electronic Cigarettes I have collected throughout the years is only
                brushing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
                just
                how
                many batteries, marketed as disposable products, end up clogging street drains and damaging wildlife. A
                lack of consideration for cell phones, laptops, headphones, and other tech littering the planet is a
                grim reminder that recycling initiatives haven't successfully impacted generations that should already
                have known better. </p><br>

            <h1>What can You do to help?</h1>
            <p>By being mindful of your waste and actively separating compost, trash, and recycling you're already one
                of many who make a huge impact on the world as we know it. It can be incredibly
                overwhelming when approached with the issue of saving our planet; but, as I humbled, I realized that I
                could still do my part and benefit from a change of perspective. As an Artist, I enjoy using my entire
                surroundings as inspiration for my work. I hope that in this effort I can not only innovate my
                creativity for the good but also learn about electronics, code, and the environment in a way I had never
                done so before. As you explore my website, I hope to inspire you to feel the same way as well.</p><br>
            <h1>Vape Anatomy.</h1><br><br>
            <div class="why_card"> <img class="VA" src="./media/vape_anatomy.jpg">
                <p>in order: cotton coil for nicotine oil, 3.5v battery, and an LED chip sensor.</p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>In this project I gutted over 100 HQD 1200 Puff Disposable Vapes. Because the device is composed of
                multiple components, I separated each piece into four major groups: Metal, Plastic, Battery, and Chip.
                The Coils wrapped in Cotton were also separated and disposed of in a separate bag. I am primarily focused
                on the LED Chip that serves to indicate the activation and lifespan of the battery within.</p><br>
            <div class="why_card">
                <img class="chip" src="./media/chip_back.jpg">
                <img class="chip" src="./media/chip_front.jpg">
                <p>back sensor & front LED</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This microchip might be small but it has many capabilities! Most notably there are three wires: Live,
                Ground, and a third signal that connects the piece down to the coil. Conducting electricity between the
                battery
                and the coil, this LED is responsible for telling its users whenever the battery is powered on and
                whenever there is no longer a battery within the cell. The LED is mounted on a small circuit board and
                whenever a current is sent through it, the LED lights up to indicate as such. It differentiates each
                signal by gauging how many volts are being put out (hence the level of power in a battery) and changes
                between a blink pattern at 3v and a soft start & end at 5v.</p><br>
            <div class="why_card">

                <p>LED Chips nestled within a diffusing plastic case.</p>
            </div><br>

            <p>Once I finished safely taking apart each vape, I separated the Chips out from everything else so that I
                could focus on exposing the wires and testing each individually to make sure that they still functioned
                normally. Being new to electrics as a whole, learning how to solder and connect electricity was one of
                the most important aspects of completing this project successfully. I had the fortunate experience of using my college resources to meet the people who would send me in the right direction. Visiting
                Maker Faire 2023, I was inspired to take a more artistic approach to this endeavor and what was once so
                foreign to me feels like a new wave of passion for my artwork to grow.</p><br>

            <h1>It Begins</h1>

            <p>I had to pay close attention to each pole of conductivity to create a sculpture that not only
                utilizes the LEDs but also allows them to function interactively. I was lucky enough to not have to
                worry about the Signal wires (for now) because the chips are nonetheless responsive to both input and
                output requests. The level of interactibility goes beyond even what this project entails thanks to the
                inner mechanisms of this powerful sensor.</p><br>
